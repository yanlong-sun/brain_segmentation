# brain_segmentation

Step_1:  run 'Input.mâ€˜  
			put all nii.gz file  in '../test_data/'  
			we could get test data in './data/test/'  
  
Step_2:    'python pred.py'   in Google Colab (python == 2.x)  
  
Step_3:  run 'save_result_256.m'  
			convert .mat format back to .nii  
			we can get the result in './predictions'  
  
  
	  	
		  
* trained on  "CC-359"      CC0001 - CC0030  

Here we show some outputs and qualitative results of our test subjects.
